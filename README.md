# Dialectic
[Discussions](https://github.com/silvergasp/dialectic/discussions)

## About
Dialectic is an *early-stage* project to create a modern alternative to
graphical PCB designs. This is a code-first approach to PCB design. Some of the
approaches taken in dialectic may be somewhat controversial.

Why dialectic? The name came from an intentional play of words between similar
sounding terms dielectric (meaning conductive insulator) and dialectic (meaning
discourse around apposing views).

Dialectic draws inspiration from existing hardware description languages
including;
- Verilog
- VHDL
- Chisel
- XLS

And circuit description languages including;
- pycircuit
- skidl

Dialectic differs from the above in that it is intended to address areas areas
that digital logic HDL's don't. e.g.
- Analog signals and circuits.
- Power distribution.
- Firmware integration.
- BOM generation and optimization.
- PCB Automatic placement and routing.

## Contributing
Currently as dialectic is in the planning phase. To contribute just jump on the
[discussions tab](https://github.com/silvergasp/dialectic/discussions). At this
point all input is welcome e.g.
- Feature requests.
- Suggestions.
- Requests for consultation (Use issues tab for this).

## Sponsors
Dialectic currently does not have any sponsors ðŸ˜”. Please consider sponsoring
this project to help make dialectic sustainable long-term.

## Status
Currently dialectic is in the planning phase and minimal or no implementation
exists for.
